This folder contains schema designs for ODM2 created using DBWrench.    

The current ODM2 schema design is called “ODM2_DBWrench_Schema.xml”

The “older schemas” folders contains schema design files that were not versioned using GitHUB.  They are included for a complete history.  The 0.83 version was the last version created before we started to manage the schema design more formally in GitHUB.
