We will host each DATA use case here, in subdirectories.

Currently all shared information on our data use cases is found on our ODM2 Google Drive, with restricted access at this time:
  * [Spreadsheet that briefly describes each data use case with common attributes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArvBlSZGFJKHdHM0R1dJMngxdHRYOF8wUGpRdWVXUlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
  * [Individual descriptions of the data uses cases, mainly from our March 2013 workshop](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B0mUuf2-qdlTbkVaSFc1WjJNZ1U)
  * [Ongoing schema mappings spreadsheets to ODM2](https://drive.google.com/?tab=mo&authuser=0#folders/0B0mUuf2-qdlTaTdfYXJUR0NYODA)
